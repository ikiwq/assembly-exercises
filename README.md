# Assembly exercises

Inside this repo are stored a list of assembly exercises. Every folder contains a different exercise. 
Every folder has an `execise.txt` file containing the assignment and a `main.asm` file containing the solution.

### Requirements
In order to compile and execute the main.asm files, you will need the `NASM` compiler for Linux.
